![alt text](E2E_Book_Recommendation_System.jpg)


#### Data Ingestion

- Read raw datasets (e.g., books, users, ratings) from the artifacts/dataset/ directory.

- Utilize the DataIngestion component to load and preprocess data.â€‹

#### Data Transformation

- Clean and merge datasets.

- Perform feature engineering (e.g., compute average ratings, filter popular books).

- Prepare data for recommendation algorithms.â€‹

#### Model Training

- Implement recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering).

- Train models using the processed data.

- Save trained models to the artifacts/ directory.â€‹

#### Model Evaluation

- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, precision, recall).

- Fine-tune models based on evaluation results.â€‹

#### Deployment

- Develop a web application using app.py to serve recommendations.

- Containerize the application using Docker (Dockerfile provided).

- Deploy the application for end-users to interact with.â€‹

#### User Interaction

- Users input their preferences or select books.

- The system provides personalized book recommendations based on user input
